# CARC TOPMed Analysis Pipeline
Adaptation of the [TOPMed analysis pipeline](https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline) to run on CARC at USC. Scripts may be modified versions of original scripts.

Split into multiple pipelines:
- Generate PCs and GRM from array data
- Convert imputed data to GDS format
- Fit null model with PCs and GRM as covariates and test variants
